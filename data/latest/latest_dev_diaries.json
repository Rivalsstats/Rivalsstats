As the first half of Season 1 draws to a close, we recognize that some players are concerned about not having enough time to reach Gold rank and earn the Invisible Woman costume, Blood Shield reward. We have decided to make some adjustments to the reward system to accommodate and help support these players.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1. The first half of the season will conclude on February 21, 2025, at 8:00 AM (UTC+0). Eligible players will receive their respective rewards, allowing them to enjoy the fruits of their hard work ahead of time.\n\n2. The Gold rank costume rewards for the second half of the season will include: the Invisible Woman costume, Blood Shield, from the first half of the season, and the brand-new Human Torch costume, Blood Blaze, for the second half of the season. In order to claim both rewards, players must participate in at least 10 competitive matches during the second half of the season and reach Gold rank or higher. Keep in mind, this is the last opportunity to earn these costumes, as they will be replaced with new rewards in Season 2.\n\n3. The Crest of Honor rewards will remain separate for each half of the season. This means that the Crests of Honor for the first half of the season can only be earned during that period, while the Crests of Honor for the second half of the season can only be obtained within its respective timeframe.\n\nWe hope these changes give you greater flexibility. Whether you are balancing Marvel Rivals with your daily life or aiming for the stars in Competitive mode, we want you to be able to achieve your rank goals, claim your rewards, and enjoy the game to the fullest. Stay tuned on our official channels for the latest updates for the second half of the Season 1 and continue to ignite the battle!\n\n \n\nFor more information about us, check out and follow our other social channels.\n\nDiscord [https://discord.gg/marvelrivals]|X [https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals]|Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/marvelrivals]|Instagram [https://www.instagram.com/marvelrivals/]|TikTok [https://www.tiktok.com/@marvelrivals]|YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/@MarvelRivals]|Twitch [https://www.twitch.tv/marvelrivals]","imagePath":"/devDiaries/dev_diary_1739508346171.jpg"},{"id":"11","title":"Dev Talk Vol.11 | Seasonal Rank Adjustment (AGAIN!)","date":"2025/02/11","overview":"Your engagement and support mean the world to us, and we're excited to continue this journey together!","fullContent":"Hey, Rivals!\n\nAfter the release of Dev Talk 10 regarding the seasonal rank adjustment, we received a wealth of feedback from the community. A common concern was the pressure associated with having a rank reset every half-season, which has made participating in competitive mode less enjoyable. In light of the community's input, we have decided to make some changes to optimize the rank system. Here are the details:\n\n1.    The first half of the season will still conclude on February 21, 2025, at 8:00 AM (UTC+0). Players at Gold rank will receive the costume reward, as well as Crests of Honors for those in Grandmaster and above, and the Crest of Honor for the top 500 (One Above All).\n\n2.    When the second half of the season begins, there will be no rank reset. Players will retain their ranks and scores from the end of the first half. To earn new rewards, players simply need to complete 10 matches in Competitive mode and meet the relevant conditions by the end of the season. Rewards will include a new Gold rank costume and a variety of Crests of Honor, featuring distinct designs for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All.\n\nWe strive to make Marvel Rivals the best game it can be, and the community is the driving force behind this mission! Please stay tuned to our official channels for more updates on the second half of the season.

Get ready to welcome two new Super Heroes to Marvel Rivals—The Thing and Human Torch—along with some major balance adjustments. These updates are expected to shake up the battlefield during the second half of Season 1. After careful observations and consideration, we have concluded that players' ranks during the first half of Season 1 are the best indicator of their competitive skills within the season. So, we will be introducing additional rank reset to better align with the upcoming content and changes!\n\n\n\nSEASON 1 FIRST HALF RANK FINALIZATION AND REWARDS\n\nThe first half of Season 1 will conclude on February 21, 2025 at 8:00 (UTC+0), after which all ranks will be locked in. Players at Gold rank or above (season high) will receive a costume reward, and players at Grandmaster rank or above along with the Top 500 will obtain Crest of Honor.\n\n \n\n\nSEASON 1 SECOND HALF RANK RESET AND REWARDS\n\nRanks will be reset when the second half of Season 1 starts on February 21, 2025. Based on your standing at the end of the first half of Season 1, prepare for a drop of four divisions. For example, if you ended the first half of Season 1 at Diamond I, you'll start the second half at Platinum II.\n\nIn the second half of the season, we will be rolling out new costume rewards for Gold rank players, along with brand new Crests of Honor. These Crests will recognize players at Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All (the top 500), each with its own unique design to celebrate your skill!\n\nAdditionally, we want to ensure that only players who take part in the current season's competitive mode can earn the corresponding rewards. Starting from the second half of Season 1, players will need to complete at least 10 matches in competitive mode and meet the required conditions to claim their rewards.\n\n \n\n\nFUTURE SEASONS AND HALF SEASONS\n\nGoing forward, players can expect to kick off the start of each new Season with a drop of six divisions and the start of the second half of each new Season with a drop of four divisions. We will tune this as necessary!\n\nThank you for your passionate support and stay tuned on our official channels for the latest news about the second half of Season 1!\n\n \n\nFor more information about us, check out and follow our other social channels.\n \nDiscord [https://discord.gg/marvelrivals]|X [https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals]|Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/marvelrivals]|Instagram [https://www.instagram.com/marvelrivals/]|TikTok [https://www.tiktok.com/@marvelrivals]|YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/@MarvelRivals]|Twitch [https://www.twitch.tv/marvelrivals]","imagePath":"/devDiaries/dev_diary_1739508347339.jpg"},{"id":"1739508347792","title":"Family First","date":"2025/01/10","overview":"To heck with whether it's three or four; even if it's just the two of us, there's nothing we can't conquer as we're not alone!","fullContent":"Dear Rivals,\n\n \n\nAh, the journey of heroes! Whether we embrace this path willingly or face it with a hint of reluctance, we all know those moments when solitude tries to wrap its icy fingers around us.\n\nYet, through the trials and tribulations of venturing alone—no matter how often we try to downplay or glamorize them—we all resonate with that age-old truth: No one is an island. We truly thrive in the company of others.\n\nWe remember that sun-soaked summer morning a couple of years ago, when our level design and narrative teams engaged in a lively debate about a question that felt both mundane and monumental—what's the ideal party number of adventurers for an epic quest?\n\nThe level designers confidently agreed that three is the magic number! Picture it: a valiant warrior to take the hits, an elemental mage conjuring storms and fire, and a priest wielding shields and healing spells to keep the group standing strong. After all, we've seen countless triumphant triads from the legendary Three Musketeers to Asgard's Warriors Three.\n\nBut the narrative team couldn't help but chime in, saying that they're overlooking the unsung hero—the fourth member of the team! The wise sage with a salt-and-pepper mane, armed with all the knowledge of the universe, providing crucial answers around the campfire.\n\nThe level designers reacted: are you guys talking about... The Fantastic Four?\n\nAnd why not? The Fantastic Four embody everything we cherish—adventure, exploration, and that indomitable spirit that refuses to quit. From traversing the vastness of space to shaping reality itself, their footprints are etched in the annals of heroism. Sure, they've had their share of conflicts, separations, and sacrifices. Still, when that fiery 4-shaped signal lights up the skyline, even if scattered like distant islands, they find a path to one another, united and unyielding.\n\nPerhaps it's the bonds forged beyond mere bloodlines that transform them into the first line of defense against the forces of darkness!\n\nWhether we're discussing paths or bonds, as more and more islands come together, we're rapidly becoming a continent bursting with life and camaraderie. We're not the Fantastic Four, we're the Fantastic Two Thousand, the Fantastic Million, the Fantastic Twenty Million!\n\nWe may not be the \"First Family,\" nor do we share the same epic adventures, but when we share a laugh—or even a few playful jabs and curses—with our teammates in Marvel Rivals, it's undeniable: we are friends, and without a doubt, we are family!\n\nReturning to that fateful summer day, before diving into debate, the two teams were grappling with a colossal challenge—the Eternal Night Falls season. Could we really weave so many characters into a gripping vampire saga? Could we twist time itself to restore buildings destroyed in combat to their former glory? Could we create a Sanctum Sanctorum so expansive that it makes the mind boggle?\n\nAs the chatter about the ideal adventuring party continued, a designer turned to the group and said,\n\nTo heck with whether it's three or four; even if it's just the two of us, there's nothing we can't conquer as we're not alone!\n\n \n\n \n\nFor more information about us, check out and follow our other social channels.\n\nDiscord [https://discord.gg/marvelrivals]|X [https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals]|Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/marvelrivals]|Instagram [https://www.instagram.com/marvelrivals/]|TikTok [https://www.tiktok.com/@marvelrivals]|YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/@MarvelRivals]|Twitch [https://www.twitch.tv/marvelrivals]","imagePath":"/devDiaries/dev_diary_1739508347792.jpg"},{"id":"1739508348226","title":"Marvel Rivals: Dev Vision Vol. 3 | Season 1 begins!","date":"2025/01/07","overview":"Watch the full video for all the details and get ready for an unforgettable journey in Marvel Rivals!","fullContent":"Dear Rivals:\n\n \n\nIn our Dev Vision Vol 03, Creative Director, Guangguang and Lead Combat Designer, Zhiyong reveal exciting updates for the first half of Season 1: Eternal Night Falls!

At this monumental milestone and with Season 1 around the corner, let us expound upon the enduring validity of each Battle Pass and Chrono Token settlement rules.\n\n \n\n\nLUXURY BATTLE PASS\n\n \n\nThe Luxury Battle Pass, once obtained, shall endure through the ages. Now, let's go over the key tenets of what this means:\n\n \n\n        - Luxury Battle Passes do not expire. Once you purchase a Luxury Battle Pass, you can continue to redeem its rewards in subsequent seasons. At the upper right corner of any Battle Pass interface, the \"NEXUS\" button stands as a portal to the Reality Link Point, where Galacta stands sentinel over every Luxury Battle Pass you have acquired, beckoning you to access its bounties at your leisure.\n\n        - Should you desire to continue unlocking rewards of an earlier Battle pass in any subsequent season, Chrono Tokens must be acquired anew to meet the unlocking conditions of the pages of the previous Battle Pass in the new season. The reason for this is twofold: Firstly, we still recommend and encourage completing the Battle Pass within its designated season; secondly, we hope you will immerse yourselves in the new season's Battle Pass, as each Battle Pass is crafted based on the season's theme. Commencing a new season and embracing its Battle Pass will enrich your understanding of each seasonal saga.\n\n        - Please note that it is not possible to purchase Luxury Battle Pass from the previous seasons. Once a season draws to a close, the acquisition of its Luxury Battle Pass becomes an unattainable relic, even inaccessible via the Reality Link Point.\n\n \n\n \n\n\nREFRESHING AND RETAINING CHRONO TOKENS AT SEASON'S END:\n\n \n\nSome players may have noted that the Battle Pass rules mention that at the end of each season, all accumulated Chrono Tokens and their total count will be reset. However, we have seen the discussions within the community that have illuminated a quandary: what happens to the players that already spent Lattice to procure additional Chrono Tokens that have a surplus by season's close? Fear not, for we have devised a plan to protect unused Chrono Tokens purchased with Lattice from one season to the next. Here's the plan moving forward:\n\n \n\n        - Automatic Item Redemption (Luxury Battle Pass Only): As a season ends, should surplus Chrono Tokens linger and the Battle Pass remain incompletely redeemed, the system shall automatically claim remaining items in the default sequence until there are not enough Chrono Tokens to redeem any further, or all items have been redeemed. After the new season starts, you'll get an in-game mail with what you got via this automatic redemption. It's still best to manually redeem your items before the season ends, but if you miss any, the system will help minimize any Chrono Token losses.\n\n        - Chrono Tokens Refresh: After the automatic redemption, any remaining Chrono Tokens will be cleared and your total will be reset to zero.\n\n \n\nHowever, as mentioned above, we're also adding a rule to do our utmost to keep any excess Chrono Tokens that have been purchased with Lattice:\n\n \n\n      - If you've spent Lattice on Chrono Tokens in the current season, and there are still some left after the automatic redemption (no need for automatic redemption if you've already redeemed them all), a portion of them may be kept for the next season.\n\n        - The specific amount retained will be the lesser of the remaining Chrono Tokens and the total Chrono Tokens you bought with Lattice in the current season. \n\n        - Retained Chrono Tokens will be sent to you via in-game mail when the new season begins.\n\n        - These retained Chrono Tokens in the new season will be treated as being \"purchased with Lattice.\" If they're still around at the end of the following season, they'll continue into subsequent seasons, augmenting the cumulative Chrono Tokens tally and hastening your access to the various pages of the Battle Pass.\n\n        - Please note that Chrono Tokens obtained by purchasing the upgraded Luxury Battle Pass, or any additional discounted Chrono Tokens obtained via the upgraded Luxury Battle Pass (such as the 1,400 Chrono Tokens in Season 0) shall not be treated as being \"purchased with Lattice.\"\n\n \n\n \n\nHere are some examples to illustrate the aforementioned retention rules:\n\n \n\n        - Let' s say you spend a total of 1,000 Lattice to secure 1,000 Chrono Tokens in the current season. Then, the season ends, and the automatic item redemption is completed. Here’s what happens after:\n\n            ·  If 500 Chrono Tokens remain, then these 500 Chrono Tokens will be retained for the next season.\n\n            ·  If 1,500 Chrono Tokens remain, then the 1,000 purchased Chrono Tokens will be retained for the next season.\n\n \n\nFrom Season 1, the total Chrono Tokens obtained with Lattice in the current season shall be displayed in the upper right corner.\n\n \n\n \n\nWe hope this clears things up a bit. It's a bit complicated, but we wanted to give you all as much info as possible to address your concerns. Happy Holidays and Ignite the Battle!\n\n \n\n \n\nMarvel Rivals Team","imagePath":"/devDiaries/dev_diary_1739508348697.jpg"},{"id":"08","title":"Dev Talk Vol.08 | Maintaining Marvel Rivals","date":"2024/12/10","overview":"Dev Talk 08","fullContent":"Dear Rivals!\n\nSince December 6th, over 10 million players have joined the Marvel Rivals family. We never could have expected such a warm, enthusiastic reception, be it streaming platforms or social media. And it's all thanks to you! Thank you all for your love and support for Marvel Rivals!\n\nThe launch version includes loads of new content, and despite our best efforts, we couldn't make it flawless. We believe that long-term maintenance and operations are the foundation for making an online game better. After going live, we received your feedback and bug reports (which are very much appreciated!), and though we could resolve some issues immediately, others will be addressed in upcoming patch updates.\n\nGoing forward, we'll be using three kinds of maintenance for different update scenarios. Curious what to expect? Then read on!\n\n1. Hotfix: These will be used to address certain issues online without affecting the player experience, letting everyone keep playing while we work in the background. This method is mainly used for urgent issues that significantly impact the experience. Since December 6th, we've conducted a total of 46 hotfix updates, including some coupling issues with ability mechanics and server connection problems.\n2. Online Patch: In this type of maintenance, we create a patch. When this patch is released, online players can continue playing. This won't affect basic matchmaking battles, and you'll get your rewards as expected, but lobby functions like the store will be limited. Once you update to the latest version and log in to the game again, you'll have access to the latest content and features. Note that once a patch has been out for a while, anyone who hasn't updated will need to restart the client and update to the latest version to be able to play. This method is mainly used for bug fixes and small-scale new content releases. We'll be releasing our online patch to fix the bugs soon! Be sure to check the upcoming patch notes for details.\n3. Maintenance: This type of maintenance will be done at key milestones, such as the start of a new season. During this time, the servers will be taken offline, during which players won't have access to the game. We'll be using these to deliver new updates and perform server maintenance. Once the servers are back online, you can update to the latest version to experience all the new content!\n\nOur vision has always been to continuously refine the game and provide engaging content. As such, we will be listening to our community, paying close attention to your feedback, and constantly working to improve the experience. So, thank you all for sharing your feedback, and let's keep working together to make Marvel Rivals the incredible game it can be!

Therefore, we, all the creators of Marvel Rivals, would like to share some heartfelt words between friends at this particular point in time.\n\nSeeing our favorite Super Heroes brought to life is a highly attractive dream and creating a game with this many beloved characters has been a journey of turning dreams into reality. However, the more we learned about these Super Heroes – diving into their histories, developing their abilities, designing their fresh looks, and coming up with even more ways to add to their legends – the more we felt that their greatness did not stem from merely their extraordinary powers.\n\nSpider-Man has worked for a newspaper company for a living; Scarlet Witch struggles with her familial troubles; Star-Lord and his team have to repair their precious spaceship by themselves; Wolverine has struggled with the same battles in his heart and mind for centuries...not to mention even a multi-billionaire like Tony Stark has faced bankruptcy.\n\nEach of these people still shoulder everyday responsibilities and challenges, carrying aliases that each symbolize the great values and virtues they represent. They never abuse their superpowers to escape from hardships in reality; On the contrary, many of the difficulties in their lives arise from the complications brought by their superpowers... But they never choose to give up. On no account would they stop helping others, be tamed by reality, or quit working towards a better tomorrow.\n\nEven without superpowers, they choose not to give up.\n\nSo, were they really heroes because of their superpowers?\n\nThe answer may seem to be obvious. The things they have done, you do them in ordinary life. If you were in their shoes, you would make the same choices without hesitation. \n\nSuperpowers just bring a bit more excitement and fun to their lives. The choices make them heroes.\n\nSo, let us take on this great responsibility as well – let us make your life more exciting and fun while also giving you the choice to be a hero. Let us fulfill all of our dreams to play as Super Heroes, bursting with the feelings of relief and happiness. After all, the fulfillment of one’s inner child is worth the hard work.\n\nLastly, as friends, we sincerely hope you have fun playing the game and then continue on to defeat life's turmoil as the heroes you are!","imagePath":"/devDiaries/dev_diary_1739508349678.jpg"},{"id":"07","title":"Dev Talk Vol.07 | Monetization","date":"2024/12/05","overview":"Dear Rivals, Thank you so much for your excitement!","fullContent":"Dear Rivals,\n\nThank you so much for your excitement! With just a few days until launch, we wanted to dive into the various offers we will be putting forth for everyone.\n\nAs you know, Marvel Rivals is free to download and heroes, maps, and other gameplay elements are completely free. We will be charging for cosmetics that will provide only visual changes, with no stat bonuses or pay-to-win elements.\n\nThe team has poured immense effort into designing and crafting these in-game cosmetics, many of which draw inspiration from Marvel's iconic comics, films, and other works. These items are not only a tribute to Marvel’s artistic legacy but also a way for us to reinterpret and capture different facets of the Marvel universe.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n· In-Game Currencies\n\nThe game will feature two primary currencies: LATTICE and UNIT.\n\n· LATTICE (gold currency) is the premium currency, obtained via purchasing.\n· UNITS (blue currency) can be exchanged at a 1:1 ratio using LATTICE. Additionally, UNITS can be earned for free in limited quantities via the Battle Pass, Achievements, and Events.\nWhile LATTICE will also be distributed through the Battle Pass, their main acquisition method will remain via direct purchase. The pricing for LATTICE (based on Steam's U.S. region) is as follows:\n· Standard Price: USD $0.99 = 100 LATTICE \n· Top-Tier Price: USD $99.99 = 11,680 LATTICE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n· Products and Pricing\n\nCosmetic items are the only paid content in the game. Most will be sold as Bundles via the in-game store. While most Costumes (skins) in the bundles can be purchased individually, buying the full bundle will provide a discounted price.\nA standard bundle contains 5 items: a costume, MVP animation, emote, spray, and nameplate. Below is a video showcasing the content of a standard epic-level bundle:\n\n\n\nJeff-Incognito Dolphin Bundle\n\n\n\nLoki-Loki Season 2 Bundle\n\nBundle Pricing:\n· Standard Epic-Quality Bundle: 1,600 UNITS (Standard value: 2,200 UNITS, -28% discount)\n· Standard Epic-Quality MCU Bundle: 1,800 UNITS (Standard value: 2,400 UNITS, -25% discount)\n· Standard Legendary-Quality Bundle: 2,400 UNITS (Standard value: 3,300 UNITS, -28% discount)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n· Battle Pass\n\nThe Battle Pass will also feature exquisite and dazzling cosmetic items on par with those sold in bundles. Below is a video showcasing a Legendary-Quality Costume Series from the S0 Battle Pass:\n\n\n\nMantis - Galactic Wings\n\nS0 Battle Pass Details:\n· Luxury Battle Pass: 490 LATTICES (contains items with a total value of 8,000 UNITS)\n· Includes 5 costumes and related cosmetics.\n· After purchase, you will redeem items by earning CHRONO TOKENS (Battle Pass tokens) through tasks and events.\nMeanwhile, the Free Battle Pass still offers one epic-quality costume and a series of other items.\nMoreover, once you purchase a Luxury Battle Pass, you can continue to redeem its rewards in subsequent seasons if you don’t finish it during the current season. There’s no need to worry about not having enough time to complete it.\nSince S0 is shorter in duration, its Luxury Battle Pass is priced at half the standard rate of future ones and contains proportionally one half of the items.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n· Free Cosmetics\n\nIn addition to the monetization system outlined above, achievements and events will provide free costumes and other cosmetic items. Free UNITS will also be distributed, allowing you to purchase paid cosmetics without spending money while still enjoying cosmetic items. Your hard work will speak for itself as you look good on the battlefield!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis concludes our explanation of Marvel Rivals monetization system.
